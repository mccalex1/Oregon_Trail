Bugs
	- Distance landmark moves across page when continue is pressed
	- Landmark doesn't move back to (left: 1) until user clicks continue again
	- setNames() conditional for valid name
    - Ferry .gif (and maybe others) doesn't reset if it is chosen twice in a row (even with setting picSrc to "" first)
    - check supplies then go back to trail div issue
    - check before each continue if anyone has died?
