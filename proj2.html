							<p>
								Traveling to Oregon isn't easy! But if you're a banker, you'll have more money for supplies and services than a carpenter or a farmer.
								<br>
								<br>
								However, the harder you have to try, the more points you deserve! Therefore, the farmer earns the greatest number of points and the banker earns the least.

								<p>
									Try taking a journey by covered wagon across 2000 miles of plains, rivers, and mountains. Try! On the plains, will you slosh your oxen through mud and water-filled ruts or will you plod through dust six inches deep?

									How will you cross the rivers? If you have  money, you might take a ferry (if there is a ferry). Or, you can ford the river and hope you and your wagon aren't swalled alive!

									What about supplies? Well, if you're low on food you can hunt. You might get a buffalo... you might. And there are bear in the mountains.

									At the Dalles, you can try navigating the Columbia River, but if running the rapids with a makeshift raft makes you queasy, better take the Barlow Road.

									If for some reason you don't survive -- your wagon burns, or thieves steal your oxen, or you run out of provisions, or you die of cholera -- don't give up! Try again..and again..until your name is up with the others on The Oregon Top Ten.
